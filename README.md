# TOPT : a Topological OPtimization Toolbox

Authors: [Mathieu Carrière](https://mathieucarriere.github.io/website/) and [Théo Lacombe](https://tlacombe.github.io).

This repository is a work in progress. 

A minimal working example is available as a tutorial based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00530), see `tutorial_0*.ipynb`.  
This tutorial provides an introduction to generalized gradient descent and showcase it in the (very simple) case 
of _total persistence_ minimization. 

Documentation TBC.
